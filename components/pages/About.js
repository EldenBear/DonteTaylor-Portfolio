      <p>
         My name is LaDonte Taylor and I'm a full stack web developer currently studying at Rutgers Bootcamp. I plan on earning my certificate in August 2023 and
         applying my newly learned skills into the field. I am known as an innovative problem solver with high attention to detail. My area of focus is front-end
         web development using React. In my Portfolio section you'll see projects I've worked on solo as well as my group projects from Rutgers.
